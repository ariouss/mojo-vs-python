# mojo-vs-python
This code is written to test the performance of Mojo and Python with Mandelbrot.

If you want run the Python side you need to install numpy package with "pip install numpy" and then use "python main.py" command to run your Python code.

and to run the Mojo side install Mojo SDK from the official Mojo website and then run "mojo main.mojo" to run your Mojo code.

You should see the result of Mojo Mandelbrot calculation vs Python Mandelbrot and Mojo wins this battle in this scenario.
Have a fun coding :D
